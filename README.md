Usually in psychology physical tests are run to test hypothesis and theories
regarding the human behaviour. But certain aspects of human behaviour
can never be truly replicated in study groups and one such aspect is racism.
In a group of people using any type of study may it be single blind or dou-
ble blind, there is always an aspect of individuality when studying taboo
topics like racism causing the final theory to be skewed in many certain
ways due to these biases. Furthermore, if one wants to see a trend of ev-
ery changing human behaviour, the tests need to be done in high frequency
and with higher number of test subjects. However, seeing this is not truly
possible, one can easily venture to the online community where anonymity
and secrecy leads to people showing their true colors under pretext of veiled
usernames. This is where human behaviour can be noted down and a trend
can be captured against the same usernames under the popular and very
candid platform called as Reddit. The same usernames' comments can be
tracked down under certain subreddits to check how they changed over the
years and how herd mentality affected the vicious nature of their comments
and viewpoints. Certain studies have been done in the past as well such as
\She's Reddit: A source of statistically significant gendered interest infor-
mation? where authors Mike Thelwall and Emma Stuart show gender
dierences and discrimination by citing variations in interests and comments
on Reddit. Furthermore, in \Linguistic Signals under Misinformation and
Fact-Checking: Evidence from User Comments on Social Media" the authors
Shan Jiang and Christo Wilson investigate linguistic signals[3] expressed in
user comments in the presence of misinformation and fact-checking. They
conclude how the language and demeanour of people changes when the topic
being discussed has misinformation compared to topics that are presented on
facts. Hence, it can be seen that even in virtual presence, our human psyche
cannot be hidden from the real world and comments on platforms such as
Reddit do advocate for us and our personalities.
With this background, our goal is to investigate if swearing is increasing in
the comments from Reddit between the years 2006 and 2011.
